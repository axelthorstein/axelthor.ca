My joints ache with the </span><span class="c0">extra</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;weight, and the exhaustion washes over me like </span><span class="c0">wa</span><span class="c0">ves, bu</span><span class="c0">t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">every day that she grows another piece of my world falls away</span><span class="c0">. Did you know that having an extra heart in your body makes love radiate off you like steam? It makes everything in my sight glow, bathed in cream coloured light. And though my skin has stretched so much since she started growing inside me - it&rsquo;s still soft. Still warm. </span><span class="c0">I part my shirt, sliding my hands over my bump and look for movement. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is she asleep? I trace a heart around my belly button, trying to wake her. When she stretches, my </span><span class="c0">senses flood</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with every nervous feeling I&rsquo;ve ever felt. Every first kiss and roller coaster ride filling my stomach to a swell. A kaleidoscope of butterflies trying to break free. A little flutter lets me know she&rsquo;s awake and as she wakes I </span><span class="c0">trace more freely around her.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;She starts to stretch, and I see a little handprint pushing out of my skin. </span><span class="c0">Her universe expanding where she wills, just for a moment.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I place my finger to hers before it disappears. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She kicks me hard, right under my belly button; so strong I lose my breath. </span><span class="c0">I draw in deeply, creating space in my body</span><span class="c0">. She kicks again. This time so fiercely I cradle my stomach. I begin tracing more swiftly around her to maybe settle her down. I trace back and forth, back and forth over my skin. As </span><span class="c0">I run my fingers over the spot that she kicked me they get caught in something.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A little tear about the size of a ladybug. I work my little finger inside and I can feel it tear open a little more. I slip another finger in and work deeper until there&#39;s enough room for my whole hand. There&rsquo;s no pain. No blood. Just space where smooth skin used to be. I grab each side and tear open the rest of my belly, right up to the breastbone. My skin lay in piles beside me. There still no blood, but also no no baby. I strain my neck to see if she is hiding behind my ribs. But there aren&#39;t any ribs. No ribs. No lungs. No small intestine, no womb. No baby. Just a void of dark space. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I see something. A twinkle.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Many twinkles actually. Millions of little scintillations as far as the eye can see. So beautiful that I can feel tears in my eyes. And I can feel myself falling deeper and deeper into the cavatity that has appeared in my belly. Enveloped by the stange warmth of the scattered lights and darkness. I can feel the drops falling from my cheeks onto my chest and shoulders, mixing with beads of sweat that are beginning to form. I can feel myself falling now at an unimaginable speed, passing all the little lights of stars, losing my perception of distance or time. My only measure is the rapidly increasing heave of my hot breath. My body is expanding now in every direction, pushing through the boundries of my skin. Waves of heat and sweat pouring over my body while I witness the birth and death of stars, as galaxies filled with unimaginable possibilities combine and reform. My skin is getting so hot that my sweat evaporates as soon as it forms. The distance and velocity giving no relief to this fever, but are beginning to bend my perception of light into impossible shapes, passing out of my view before I can process them. Ripples of distortion and heat passing before me culminating in the infinite rapid expantion of universe. My skin now so hot to the touch. Suddenly I don&rsquo;t feel so well. I didn&rsquo;t want this in my body anymore. The almost terrifying beauty of the birth and destruction of matter and space is overwhleming at this unimaginable distance and pace. I need to push this out of my body, let it break through the boundries of my skin, and continue in its insatiable cycle of consumption and rebirth. The heat and pressure have now built past the point of preception or comprehension, so that I almost lose consiousness. My breath is almost outpacing the immense and unimaginable speed and expansion of the universe, and my skin rivals the boundries of the all matter and creation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Until in a moment, it stops. I no longer feel myself drifting through space and time, as my perception of reality begins to returns. The heat is relieved in a sweet release as my breath returns to a steady pace. No space left inside my body. Skin, ribs, lungs, and blood all return to their rightful place. I part my shirt, sliding my hands over my belly, but there is no longer any bump, no longer a baby. Then in a moment of utter clarity and satisfaction I realize she has left my body and is now being passed into my arms. This beautiful baby girl, filled with all the mysterious magic of science and nature, is now too caught in this infinite cycle of renewal and birth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c6 lst-kix_yj59yeejqn4t-0 start"><li class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Maria Bjork / Axel Thor</span></li></ul></body></html>
